# BSc in Mathematics

## Intro

To build a personal brand, one should start from his own story. A crucial part of mine is my Bachelor Degree in Mathematics.

Since more than two years, four movings from town to town and several topic switches have passed after my last Maths' exam, my BSc in Mathematics is only a recollection in the back of my mind that makes me proud, but it is not clear to me how this is affecting my present. 

The goal of these notes is to bring to my mind each course I have taken during those years and to reflect the impact they had on me.

## First year

### Algebra 1

This was completely new. Ok, some resembrance of "sets", but besides that everything was new. And everything was beautiful. 

From the start, the properties of relationships (reflexivity, simmetry, antisymmetry, transitivity) and new perspective  on the definitions of functions, gave me some of the principles I still carry with me:
    
- Formal definitions give a solid basement for knowledge. They break concepts into parts, and make them manageable. 
    They allow you to build upon them, or to dig into each part.
    Break each part, and you will understand why they are there for, what you can substitute them with. 
- Maths is about watching something from other perspectives, play with it and see what happens. The first day, professor said: "Algebra is finding connections between things".
