# Brand


I'm going to create a _kind of_ a personal brand. Not because I want to push myself out there that much, but because if I post or create anything, I don't want to think "what color should I use? Which font?" every time. 
I'm definetely not a designer nor a marketer, so I will just record my process of googling things and asking advices to friends about it.

## Choose a color palette

It seems that every color has a meaning, and they say to choose something that reflects what I want to communicate. 
However, as I always do, I started from "what the final product looks like in my mind". It's not yet well defined, but definetely I can see a vivid blue, and some juggling balls where yellow, green and red or purple is visible.
Now I will look into the meaning of them:
-   <span style="color:blue">**Blue**</span>: Intelligence, wisdom, integrity, leadership, authority, truth, peace, loyalty, reliability, confidence, hope, clarity, communication, imagination
    -   ok, approved âœ…
-  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><span style="color:yellow">**Yellow**</span></span>: Sunshine, joy, warmth, happiness, caution, warning, vision, intellect, creativity, light, self-motivation, independence
   -  well, these things sound like horoscopes...
-  <span style="color:green">**Green**</span>: Growth, rebirth, nature, optimism, spring, change, fertility, relaxation, youth, luck, healing, environment, prosperity, safety
    - Fine, I don't know if it can live with blue btw
- <span style="color:red">**Red**</span>: Power, attention, love, activity, potency, energy, desire, action, passion, determination, courage, vitality, motivation, playfulness, enthusiasm
  - why am I doing this
- <span style="color:purple">**Purple**</span>: Royalty, ambition, wealth, competition, mystery, spirituality, mysticism, inspiration, magic, dignity, luxury, personal power, self-worth
